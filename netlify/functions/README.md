# Netlify Functions for API Routes

# This directory contains serverless functions for Netlify
# Each function should be a separate file in this directory

# Example function structure:
# hello-world.js
# exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
#   return {
#     statusCode: 200,
#     body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello World!' })
#   }
# }

# For your travel business SaaS, you might need:
# - auth.js (authentication endpoints)
# - bookings.js (booking management)
# - tours.js (tour management)
# - users.js (user management)
# - uploads.js (file upload handling)

# Each function will be available at:
