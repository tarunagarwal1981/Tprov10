# ðŸ“¦ Storage Bucket Setup Guide - Fix 500 Error

## Problem
Getting **500 Internal Server Error** when uploading images because:
1. Storage bucket doesn't exist OR
2. Storage bucket policies are not configured

## Solution: Use Supabase Dashboard (Not SQL)

You can't set storage policies via SQL Editor due to permissions. Use the Supabase Dashboard instead:

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Storage
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/megmjzszmqnmzdxwzigt
2. Click **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Look for a bucket named `activity-packages`

### Step 2A: If Bucket Doesn't Exist â†’ Create It

1. Click **"New bucket"** button (top right)
2. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `activity-packages`
   - **Public bucket:** âœ… **ON** (toggle to enabled)
   - **File size limit:** 52428800 (50 MB)
   - **Allowed MIME types:** Leave empty (allow all) or add: `image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif`
3. Click **"Create bucket"**

### Step 2B: If Bucket Exists â†’ Check Settings

1. Click on the `activity-packages` bucket
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon at top)
3. Verify:
   - âœ… **Public bucket** is **ON**
   - âœ… File size limit is reasonable (at least 10 MB)
4. Click **Save** if you made changes

### Step 3: Configure Bucket Policies

1. While in the `activity-packages` bucket, click **"Policies"** tab
2. You should see a button **"New Policy"** or policy configuration

#### Policy 1: Allow Authenticated Users to Upload (REQUIRED)

Click **"New Policy"** and configure:

```
Policy name: Allow authenticated uploads
Allowed operation: INSERT
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression: (bucket_id = 'activity-packages'::text)
WITH CHECK expression: ((bucket_id = 'activity-packages'::text) AND ((storage.foldername(name))[1] = (auth.uid())::text))
```

**Or use the "For authenticated users only" template and customize it.**

#### Policy 2: Allow Public Read Access (REQUIRED)

Click **"New Policy"** again:

```
Policy name: Public read access
Allowed operation: SELECT
Target roles: public
USING expression: (bucket_id = 'activity-packages'::text)
```

**Or use the "For public read access" template.**

#### Policy 3: Allow Authenticated Users to Delete (Optional)

```
Policy name: Allow authenticated delete
Allowed operation: DELETE
Target roles: authenticated
USING expression: ((bucket_id = 'activity-packages'::text) AND ((storage.foldername(name))[1] = (auth.uid())::text))
```

### Step 4: Alternative - Use Policy Templates

Supabase provides templates. When creating a policy:

1. Click **"Use a template"** dropdown
2. Select these templates:
   - âœ… **"Allow authenticated uploads"** â†’ Customize bucket_id to `activity-packages`
   - âœ… **"Allow public read access"** â†’ Customize bucket_id to `activity-packages`
3. Click **Save policy** for each

## ðŸ”§ Quick Visual Checklist

After setup, your Storage â†’ activity-packages â†’ Policies should show:

```
âœ… Policy: Allow authenticated uploads
   Operation: INSERT
   Target: authenticated users

âœ… Policy: Public read access  
   Operation: SELECT
   Target: public (everyone)

âœ… Policy: Allow authenticated delete (optional)
   Operation: DELETE
   Target: authenticated users
```

## âœ… Verification

### Test 1: Upload via Dashboard
