# üéØ Final Setup Instructions - Use Existing Bucket

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

1. ‚úÖ Code updated to use your existing bucket: `activity-packages-images`
2. ‚úÖ Database RLS policies fixed (if you ran the SQL)
3. ‚è≥ **Still need:** Storage policies on your existing bucket

---

## üöÄ Complete These Steps (10 minutes)

### **Step 1: Commit and Deploy Code Fix** ‚è±Ô∏è 5 min

The code now uses `activity-packages-images` bucket. Deploy it:

```bash
# In your terminal (you're in dev branch):
git add -A
git commit -m "Use existing activity-packages-images bucket"
git push origin dev

# Merge to main:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge dev
git push origin main
```

Wait for Netlify to deploy (~2-3 minutes).

---

### **Step 2: Fix Database RLS (if not done)** ‚è±Ô∏è 2 min

Run this quick SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE activity_packages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE activity_package_images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop old policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Operators can insert their own packages" ON activity_packages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Operators can view their own packages" ON activity_packages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Operators can update their own packages" ON activity_packages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view package images" ON activity_package_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Operators can insert images for their packages" ON activity_package_images;

-- Create permissive policies for testing
CREATE POLICY "Operators can insert their own packages"
ON activity_packages FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Operators can view their own packages"
ON activity_packages FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Operators can update their own packages"
ON activity_packages FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view package images"
ON activity_package_images FOR SELECT TO public
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Operators can insert images for their packages"
ON activity_package_images FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);
```

This fixes the **409 Conflict** error.

### **Step 3: Add Storage Policies to Your Bucket** ‚è±Ô∏è 3 min

**You MUST do this via Dashboard UI** (cannot use SQL):

#### 3.1 Open Your Bucket
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/megmjzszmqnmzdxwzigt/storage/buckets
2. Click on **`activity-packages-images`** bucket

#### 3.2 Check Bucket Settings
1. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Make sure **"Public bucket"** is ‚úÖ **ON**
3. Click **Save** if needed

#### 3.3 Add 4 Storage Policies

Click **"Policies"** tab, then **"New Policy"** for each:

---

**Policy #1: Allow Upload**
```
Policy name: Allow authenticated uploads
Allowed operation: INSERT
Target roles: authenticated

Policy definition (WITH CHECK):
bucket_id = 'activity-packages-images'
```

---

**Policy #2: Allow Public Read**
```
Policy name: Public read access
Allowed operation: SELECT
Target roles: public

Policy definition (USING):
bucket_id = 'activity-packages-images'
```

---

**Policy #3: Allow Update** (Optional)
```
Policy name: Allow authenticated updates
Allowed operation: UPDATE
Target roles: authenticated

Policy definition (USING):
bucket_id = 'activity-packages-images' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
```

---

**Policy #4: Allow Delete** (Optional)
```
Policy name: Allow authenticated deletes
Allowed operation: DELETE
Target roles: authenticated

Policy definition (USING):
bucket_id = 'activity-packages-images' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
```

---

### **Step 4: Test** ‚úÖ

1. Wait for Netlify deployment to complete
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
3. Go to: https://travelselbuy.netlify.app
4. Try creating a package with images
5. Should work! üéâ

## üìä What Each Step Fixes

| Step | Fixes | Error |
|------|-------|-------|
| Step 1: Deploy | Code uses correct bucket name | ‚úÖ 500 error |
| Step 2: Database RLS | INSERT permission | ‚úÖ 409 conflict |
| Step 3: Storage policies | Upload permission | ‚úÖ 500 error |

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Code committed and pushed to dev
- [ ] Merged dev ‚Üí main
- [ ] Netlify deployed successfully
- [ ] Database RLS SQL executed
- [ ] Bucket is public
- [ ] Policy #1 (INSERT) added
- [ ] Policy #2 (SELECT) added
- [ ] Policy #3 (UPDATE) added (optional)
- [ ] Policy #4 (DELETE) added (optional)
- [ ] Tested package creation - works!

## üéØ TL;DR - What To Do Right Now

1. **Terminal:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Use existing bucket"
   git push origin dev
   git checkout main
   git merge dev
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Supabase SQL Editor:** Run the SQL from Step 2 above

3. **Supabase Storage Dashboard:** Add 4 policies to `activity-packages-images` bucket

4. **Test:** Create a package with images

---

**That's it! Package creation should work after these steps.** üöÄ
