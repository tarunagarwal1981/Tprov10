### For Developers:

**Using the Marketplace Service:**
```typescript
import { MarketplaceService } from '@/lib/services/marketplaceService';

// Fetch available leads
const leads = await MarketplaceService.getAvailableLeads({
  destination: 'Bali',
  tripType: TripType.BEACH,
  budgetMin: 1000,
  budgetMax: 5000,
});

// Purchase a lead
await MarketplaceService.purchaseLead(leadId, agentId);

// Get agent's purchases
const purchases = await MarketplaceService.getAgentPurchasedLeads(agentId);
```

**Using Marketplace Components:**
```typescript
import { LeadCard, LeadFilters } from '@/components/marketplace';

<LeadCard
  lead={marketplaceLead}
  onViewDetails={handleView}
  onPurchase={handlePurchase}
  isPurchased={false}
/>

<LeadFilters
  filters={filters}
  onChange={setFilters}
  onReset={resetFilters}
/>
```
