## üöÄ Setup Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Create a new query
4. Copy contents from `supabase/migrations/002_create_activity_package_vehicles.sql`
5. Paste and click "Run"
6. Verify success message

**Option B: Using Supabase CLI** (if installed)
```bash
supabase db push
```

### 2. Verify Database Setup

Run this query in SQL Editor to verify:
```sql
-- Check table exists
SELECT * FROM activity_package_vehicles LIMIT 0;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'activity_package_vehicles';
```

### 3. Test the Feature

1. **Login** as an operator
2. **Navigate** to: Operator Dashboard ‚Üí Packages ‚Üí Create Activity Package
3. Go to **"Pricing"** tab
4. Click **"Add Pricing Option"**
5. Set **Package Type** to "Private Transfer"
6. **Vehicle section** should appear automatically

   - Vehicle Type: Select from dropdown or "Others"
   - Max Capacity: Enter number (e.g., 4)
   - Category: Select from dropdown
   - Custom Type: If "Others" selected, enter custom name
8. **Add multiple vehicles** to test multiple vehicles feature
9. Click **"Save Draft"** or **"Publish Package"**
10. **Reload** the page and verify vehicles are saved and loaded correctly

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check if vehicles are being saved:
```sql
SELECT 
  v.id,
  v.vehicle_type,
  v.max_capacity,
  v.vehicle_category,
  v.description,
  pp.package_name as pricing_package_name
FROM activity_package_vehicles v
JOIN activity_pricing_packages pp ON v.pricing_package_id = pp.id
ORDER BY v.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check vehicle count per package:
```sql
SELECT 
  pp.package_name,
  pp.transfer_type,
  COUNT(v.id) as vehicle_count
FROM activity_pricing_packages pp
LEFT JOIN activity_package_vehicles v ON v.pricing_package_id = pp.id
WHERE pp.transfer_type = 'PRIVATE'
GROUP BY pp.id, pp.package_name, pp.transfer_type;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Vehicle section not showing
- **Check:** Is package type set to "Private Transfer"?
- **Solution:** The section only appears for PRIVATE_TRANSFER type

### Issue: Vehicles not saving
- **Check:** Database migration applied?
- **Solution:** Run the migration SQL file

### Issue: Permission denied error
- **Check:** RLS policies created?
- **Solution:** Verify policies exist with query above

### Issue: Vehicles not loading on edit
- **Check:** Browser console for errors
- **Check:** Network tab for failed API calls
- **Solution:** Verify `getVehiclesForPricingPackage()` is being called
