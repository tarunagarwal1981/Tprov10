# Lead Marketplace Service Implementation

## 📋 Overview
Complete implementation of the Lead Marketplace service layer for tprov10, enabling travel agents to browse, purchase, and manage leads.

## ✅ Created Files

### 1. **Marketplace Service** - `src/lib/services/marketplaceService.ts`

A comprehensive service class providing all marketplace operations:

#### Core Functions:
- ✅ `getAvailableLeads(filters?)` - Get all available leads with optional filtering
- ✅ `getLeadDetails(leadId, agentId)` - Get detailed lead info (hides sensitive data if not purchased)
- ✅ `purchaseLead(leadId, agentId)` - Purchase a lead with validation
- ✅ `getAgentPurchasedLeads(agentId)` - Get all leads purchased by an agent
- ✅ `hasAgentPurchased(leadId, agentId)` - Check if agent already purchased a lead
- ✅ `getMarketplaceStats(agentId)` - Get marketplace statistics for an agent

#### Bonus Functions:
- ✅ `searchLeads(searchTerm, filters?)` - Advanced search with text matching
- ✅ `getFeaturedLeads(limit)` - Get high-quality leads (score ≥ 80)
- ✅ `getExpiringSoonLeads()` - Get leads expiring within 24 hours

### 2. **Database Types Updated** - `src/lib/supabase/types.ts`

Added complete type definitions for:

#### New Tables:
```typescript
lead_marketplace: {
  Row: { /* 22 fields including hidden customer data */ }
  Insert: { /* Insert type with defaults */ }
  Update: { /* Partial update type */ }
  Relationships: []
}

lead_purchases: {
  Row: { /* Purchase record fields */ }
  Insert: { /* Insert type */ }
  Update: { /* Update type */ }
  Relationships: [
    { to: lead_marketplace }
    { to: users (auth) }
  ]
}
```

#### New Enums:
```typescript
lead_status: 'AVAILABLE' | 'PURCHASED' | 'EXPIRED'
trip_type: 'ADVENTURE' | 'CULTURAL' | 'BEACH' | 'WILDLIFE' | 'LUXURY' | 'BUDGET' | 'FAMILY' | 'HONEYMOON'
```

#### Type Aliases:
```typescript
export type LeadMarketplace
export type LeadPurchase
export type LeadMarketplaceInsert
export type LeadPurchaseInsert
export type LeadMarketplaceUpdate
export type LeadPurchaseUpdate
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Privacy Protection**
- Automatically hides sensitive customer data (name, email, phone) until lead is purchased
- Checks purchase status before revealing full details

### 2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Uses Supabase error handling utilities
- Detailed error logging with `[MarketplaceService]` prefix
- Graceful degradation (returns empty arrays/zeros on errors where appropriate)

### 3. **Smart Filtering**
All filter methods support:
- Destination search (case-insensitive, partial match)
- Trip type filtering
- Budget range filtering
- Duration filtering
- Quality score filtering
- Status filtering

### 4. **Validation**
Purchase validation checks:
- ✅ Lead exists and is available
- ✅ Lead hasn't expired
- ✅ Agent hasn't already purchased the lead
- ✅ All validations before creating purchase record

### 5. **Efficient Queries**
- Proper use of Supabase query builder
- Indexed fields for performance
- JOIN support for related data
- Pagination ready (limit supported)

## 📊 Statistics Support

The `getMarketplaceStats()` function provides:
```typescript
{
  totalAvailable: number;  // Current available leads
  purchased: number;        // Total purchases by agent
  thisMonth: number;        // Purchases this month
  totalSpent: number;       // Total amount spent
}
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS) Ready**
   - Service relies on Supabase RLS policies
   - Agent ID authentication through auth context
   - Automatic enforcement of purchase restrictions

2. **Data Sanitization**
   - Hidden fields explicitly set to `undefined` for unpurchased leads
   - No sensitive data leakage in API responses

3. **Purchase Integrity**
   - Database trigger automatically updates lead status
   - Unique constraint prevents duplicate purchases
   - Transaction safety through Supabase

## 🎨 TypeScript Best Practices

- ✅ Full type safety with Supabase generated types
- ✅ Proper enum usage (LeadStatus, TripType)
- ✅ Type mapping functions for DB ↔ Client conversion
- ✅ JSDoc comments for all functions
- ✅ Proper error typing with SupabaseError class

## 📦 Usage Examples

### Get Available Leads with Filters
```typescript
import MarketplaceService from '@/lib/services/marketplaceService';
import { TripType } from '@/lib/types/marketplace';

const leads = await MarketplaceService.getAvailableLeads({
  destination: 'Paris',
  tripType: TripType.LUXURY,
  budgetMin: 5000,
  budgetMax: 10000,
  minQualityScore: 80
});
```

### Purchase a Lead
```typescript
try {
  const purchase = await MarketplaceService.purchaseLead(
    'lead-uuid',
    'agent-uuid'
  );
  console.log('Successfully purchased lead:', purchase);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'ALREADY_PURCHASED') {
    // Handle duplicate purchase
  }
}
```

### Get Agent Statistics
```typescript
const stats = await MarketplaceService.getMarketplaceStats('agent-uuid');
console.log(`Available: ${stats.totalAvailable}`);
console.log(`Purchased: ${stats.purchased}`);
console.log(`This Month: ${stats.thisMonth}`);
console.log(`Total Spent: $${stats.totalSpent}`);
```

### Search Leads
```typescript
const results = await MarketplaceService.searchLeads(
  'beach vacation family',
  { minQualityScore: 70 }
);
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Pattern

Follows tprov10 conventions:
- Static class methods (no instantiation needed)
- Supabase client creation per method call
- Consistent error handling pattern
- Proper logging with service prefix
- Type-safe database operations

## ✅ Build Status

All files compile successfully:
- ✓ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✓ Linting passed
- ✓ No type errors
- ✓ Next.js build successful

## 🚀 Next Steps

The service layer is complete and ready for:
1. React hooks implementation (useMarketplace, usePurchaseLead, etc.)
2. UI components (LeadCard, LeadDetails, PurchaseButton)
3. Agent dashboard integration
4. Real-time lead updates (Supabase subscriptions)
5. Analytics and reporting

## 📝 Notes

- Service assumes Supabase auth context is properly configured
- RLS policies in migration file must be applied for security
- Database migration must be run before using the service
- Consider rate limiting for purchase operations in production
