### **Fix #2: Try Incognito/Private Mode**

**This helps identify if browser extensions are the problem**

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)

**Firefox:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)

**Safari:**
- File → New Private Window

**Then:**
1. Go to the login page in the private window
2. Try logging in
3. **If it works:** Browser extensions are blocking it → See Fix #3
4. **If it still fails:** Network issue → See Fix #4

---

### **Fix #3: Disable Browser Extensions**

**If login works in Incognito but not in normal mode, extensions are blocking it**

**Common culprits:**
- ✋ Ad blockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus)
- ✋ Privacy extensions (Privacy Badger, Ghostery)
- ✋ Security extensions (NoScript, HTTPS Everywhere)
- ✋ VPN extensions

**How to disable:**

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Click the puzzle icon (Extensions) in toolbar
2. Click "Manage extensions"
3. Turn off ALL extensions
4. Try login
5. If it works, enable extensions one by one to find the culprit

**Firefox:**
1. Click menu (☰) → Add-ons and themes
2. Click Extensions
3. Disable ALL extensions
4. Try login

---

### **Fix #4: Check Your Network**

**If nothing above works, your network might be blocking Supabase**

**Test the connection:**
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Paste this code and press Enter:

```javascript
console.time('Test');
fetch('https://megmjzszmqnmzdxwzigt.supabase.co/rest/v1/')
  .then(r => {
    console.timeEnd('Test');
    console.log('✅ Connection OK:', r.status);
  })
  .catch(e => {
    console.timeEnd('Test');
    console.error('❌ Connection FAILED:', e.message);
  });
```

**Expected result:** Should show "✅ Connection OK: 200" in less than 1 second

**If it fails or takes > 3 seconds:**

**Option A: Disable VPN**
- If you're using a VPN, disconnect it temporarily
- Try login again

**Option B: Use Mobile Hotspot**
- Connect to your phone's mobile hotspot
- Try login again
- If it works → Your office/home network is blocking it

**Option C: Contact IT Department**
- Ask them to whitelist: `*.supabase.co`
- Explain it's needed for the business application

### **Fix #5: Update Your Browser**

**Old browsers might not support modern features**

**Check your browser version:**
- Chrome/Edge: Help → About Google Chrome/Edge
- Firefox: Help → About Firefox
- Safari: Safari → About Safari

**Minimum required versions:**
- Chrome: 90+
- Firefox: 88+
- Edge: 90+
- Safari: 14+

**If outdated:** Update to the latest version
