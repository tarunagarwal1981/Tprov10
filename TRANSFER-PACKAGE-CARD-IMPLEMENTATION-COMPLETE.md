## 🎨 Card Display Features

### Image Carousel
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Auto-carousel: Vehicle Images]    │  ← 4-sec rotation
│  📷 Mercedes S-Class               │  ← Vehicle name overlay
│  [⏸] [◀️] [▶️] [● ○ ○ ○]          │  ← Controls
│  [3 Vehicles]        [Published]   │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Premium Airport Transfer          │
│  Luxury chauffeur service...       │
│                                    │
│  🚗 Sedan • SUV • Van             │
│  👥 4-12 passengers               │
│                                    │
│  🕐 Hourly Rentals: $50 - $80/hr  │
│  📍 One-Way: $120 - $300          │
│                                    │
│  [View] [Edit]             [⋮]    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Price Display Logic
- **Min-Max Range**: Shows "$50 - $80/hr" when prices vary
- **Single Price**: Shows "$50/hr" when all prices are the same
- **No Pricing**: Shows "No pricing configured" when empty
- **Split by Type**: Hourly and One-Way shown separately

### Vehicle Information
- **Count Badge**: Shows total vehicles (top-left overlay)
- **Type List**: Shows up to 3 types (e.g., "Sedan • SUV • Van")
- **Overflow**: Shows "+2" for additional types beyond 3
- **Capacity**: Shows range (e.g., "4-12 passengers") or single value

## 🔗 Database Integration

### Tables Connected
✅ **transfer_packages** - Main package data
✅ **transfer_package_vehicles** - Vehicle details
✅ **transfer_vehicle_images** - Vehicle-specific images
✅ **transfer_hourly_pricing** - Hourly rental pricing
✅ **transfer_point_to_point_pricing** - One-way transfer pricing

### Data Flow
```
User visits /operator/packages
      ↓
listTransferPackagesWithCardData({ operator_id })
      ↓
Fetch transfer_packages
      ↓
Fetch vehicles, images, pricing in parallel
      ↓
Group by package_id and vehicle_id
      ↓
Return enriched package data
      ↓
Render TransferPackageCard for each
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### 1. **Fetching Data**
When you visit the packages page:
- Fetches all transfer packages for the current operator
- Includes vehicles, vehicle images, and all pricing options
- Optimized with parallel queries for speed

### 2. **Displaying Cards**
Transfer packages appear in their own section:
- Header: "Transfer Packages (3)" with car icon
- Grid layout (3 columns on desktop, responsive)
- Each card shows carousel with vehicle images
- Price ranges calculated automatically

### 3. **User Actions**
- **View**: Opens view-only mode (`?view=true`)
- **Edit**: Opens edit form
- **Duplicate**: Shows "coming soon" message (placeholder)
- **Delete**: Confirms and deletes with cascade

### 4. **Filtering**
Transfer packages respect the same filters as other packages:
- Status filter (All, Active, Draft, etc.)
- Search by title
- Real-time filtering

---

## 📊 Stats Integration

Stats cards now include transfer packages:
- **Total Packages**: Counts transfer + activity + multi-city
- **Active Count**: Includes published transfer packages
- **Revenue**: Will calculate when bookings added
- **Avg Rating**: Placeholder for now

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Carousel Speed
```typescript
// In TransferPackageCard.tsx, line ~97
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  setCurrentImageIndex(...);
}, 5000); // Change from 4000 to 5000 for 5 seconds
```

### Change Price Color
```typescript
// In TransferPackageCard.tsx, line ~338 and ~347
className="font-semibold text-blue-600" // Change from text-[#FF6B35]
```

### Change Max Images
```typescript
// In TransferPackageCard.tsx, line ~92
.slice(0, 10); // Change from 5 to 10 for more images
```

### Change Section Order
Move the Transfer Packages section below other packages by swapping the rendering order in `page.tsx`.

## 📝 Code Examples

### Fetching Transfer Packages
```typescript
const { data, error } = await listTransferPackagesWithCardData({
  operator_id: user.id,
  // status: 'published' // optional filter
});
```

### Rendering the Card
```typescript
<TransferPackageCard
  package={pkg}
  onView={handleViewTransferPackage}
  onEdit={handleEditTransferPackage}
  onDuplicate={handleDuplicateTransferPackage}
  onDelete={handleDeleteTransferPackage}
/>
```

### Filtering Transfer Packages
```typescript
const filtered = transferPackages.filter(pkg => {
  // Status filter
  if (statusFilter === 'ACTIVE') return pkg.status === 'published';
  // Search filter
  return pkg.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());
});
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Images" Showing
**Solution:** Verify:
- Images uploaded to `transfer_vehicle_images` table
- `public_url` field is not null
- Storage bucket is public

### Issue: Pricing Not Showing
**Solution:** Check:
- Pricing saved to database tables
- `package_id` foreign key is correct
- At least one pricing option exists

### Issue: Carousel Not Rotating
**Solution:**
- Must have 2+ images
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `isPaused` is false

### Issue: Card Not Rendering
**Solution:**
- Check `listTransferPackagesWithCardData()` returns data
- Verify operator_id matches current user
- Look for errors in browser console
