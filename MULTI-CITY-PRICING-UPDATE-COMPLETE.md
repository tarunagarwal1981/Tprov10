---

## 📦 What Was Changed

### 1. **Database Changes**

#### Migration File: `005_create_multi_city_pricing_packages.sql`

**New Tables Created:**

1. **`multi_city_pricing_packages`**
   - Stores pricing package templates (Basic, Premium, VIP, etc.)
   - Supports two types: `STANDARD` and `GROUP`
   - Fields for Standard pricing: adult_price, child_price (with age ranges), infant_price
   - Fields for inclusions/exclusions specific to each package
   - is_featured, is_active flags for display control
   
2. **`multi_city_pricing_groups`**
   - Group size tiers for GROUP pricing type
   - Fields: min_capacity, max_capacity, price (total for group)
   - Optional: vehicle_type, accommodation_notes
   - Linked to pricing_package_id

**Updates to Existing Tables:**

- `multi_city_packages` table:
  - ✅ Added: `package_validity_date` (DATE) - Last date package is valid for bookings
  - ⚠️ Kept old pricing fields (`pricing_mode`, `fixed_price`, `per_person_price`) for backward compatibility (marked as deprecated)

**Indexes Created:**
- Performance indexes on package_id, pricing_type, display_order
- Capacity range indexes for group pricing

**RLS Policies:**
- Full row-level security for both tables
- Operators can manage their own packages
- Public can view active packages for published tours

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

   - Reason: Backward compatibility
   - Can be removed in future migration after data migration

2. Frontend labels show "Standard" and "Group" 
   - Can be changed to better names in UI without DB changes
   - Just update the display strings in the component

3. Inclusions/Exclusions per package not yet implemented in UI
   - Schema supports it
   - Can be added in future iteration

---

## ✅ Testing Results

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Linter: No errors
- ✅ Database migration: Ready to apply
- ✅ Form validation: Working correctly
- ✅ UI responsiveness: Mobile-friendly
