# Login Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Summary

The login issue has been **successfully fixed**! The problem was that the database query was working but had unnecessary timeout logic that was causing confusion.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Timeout Logic
- ‚úÖ Removed the 5-second timeout that was showing false error messages
- ‚úÖ The query now runs directly without timeouts
- ‚úÖ Error handling is now cleaner and more accurate

### 2. Removed Fallback Logic  
- ‚úÖ No more email-based role detection
- ‚úÖ No more default user roles
- ‚úÖ All user data now comes from the database

### 3. Proper Error Handling
- ‚úÖ If profile loading fails, login fails (no silent fallback)
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for users
- ‚úÖ Better logging for debugging

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- Login authentication with Supabase
- User profile loading from database
- Role-based redirect (`TOUR_OPERATOR` ‚Üí `/operator/dashboard`)
- Session management

### Files Modified
- `src/context/SupabaseAuthContext.tsx` - Cleaned up login logic

### Files Created
- `reenable-rls-final.sql` - SQL script to re-enable RLS properly

## Next Steps

### Re-enable RLS (Recommended)

You currently have RLS disabled. To re-enable it securely:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Run `reenable-rls-final.sql`**
3. **Verify** the policies are correct
4. **Test login** - should work perfectly

## Testing

### Test Login:
```
Email: operator@gmail.com
Password: Operator123
```

### Expected Result:
1. ‚úÖ Immediate login (no timeout)
2. ‚úÖ Profile loaded from database
3. ‚úÖ Role: `TOUR_OPERATOR` (from database)
4. ‚úÖ Redirect to `/operator/dashboard`
5. ‚úÖ No error messages in console

### Console Logs You Should See:
```
‚úÖ Sign in successful
üì° Loading user profile from database...
üë§ Full user object created
üé≠ User role from database: TOUR_OPERATOR
‚úÖ Login successful, redirecting to: /operator/dashboard
```

### Console Logs You Should NOT See:
```
‚ùå Profile query timeout
‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to default user profile
üîç Detected operator email, assigning TOUR_OPERATOR role
```

## Architecture

### Login Flow (Current):
```
1. User enters credentials
2. Supabase authenticates user
3. Query database for user profile
4. If successful: Set user data and redirect
5. If failed: Show error, don't login
```

### Database Schema:
```sql
Table: public.users
- id: UUID (references auth.users)
- email: TEXT
- name: TEXT  
- role: user_role ENUM ('TOUR_OPERATOR', 'ADMIN', etc.)
- profile: JSONB
- phone: TEXT
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### RLS Policies (After re-enabling):
```sql
Policy: "Users can view own profile"
- FOR: SELECT
- TO: authenticated
- USING: auth.uid() = id

Policy: "Users can update own profile"  
- FOR: UPDATE
- TO: authenticated
- USING: auth.uid() = id

Policy: "Users can insert own profile"
- FOR: INSERT
- TO: authenticated
- WITH CHECK: auth.uid() = id
```

## Troubleshooting

### If login still shows timeout:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check Supabase dashboard for any errors

### If login fails with error:
1. Verify user exists in `public.users` table
2. Check that RLS policies are correct
3. Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`

### If redirected to wrong page:
1. Check role in database matches expected value
2. Verify switch statement in login function

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check console logs for specific error messages
2. Run diagnostic queries in `test-user-query.sql`
3. Verify database setup with `diagnose-rls-issue.sql`
