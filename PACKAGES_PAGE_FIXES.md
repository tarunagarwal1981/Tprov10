# Packages Page 3-Dot Menu Fixes

## Summary
Fixed all dropdown menu options (View, Edit, Duplicate, Delete) on the operator dashboard packages page to make them fully functional.

## Changes Made

### 1. **View Button** ✅
- **Before**: Only showed a toast message, didn't navigate anywhere
- **After**: Navigates to the appropriate edit page with a `view=true` query parameter
- **Implementation**: 
  ```typescript
  const handleViewPackage = (pkg: Package) => {
    const viewPath = pkg.type === 'Activity' 
      ? `/operator/packages/create/activity?id=${pkg.id}&view=true`
      : pkg.type === 'Transfer'
      ? `/operator/packages/create/transfer?id=${pkg.id}&view=true`
      : pkg.type === 'Multi-City'
      ? `/operator/packages/create/multi-city?id=${pkg.id}&view=true`
      : `/operator/packages/create?id=${pkg.id}&view=true`;
    router.push(viewPath);
  };
  ```

### 2. **Edit Button** ✅
- **Before**: Used `window.location.href` which is not ideal for Next.js
- **After**: Uses Next.js router for proper navigation
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  const handleEditPackage = (pkg: Package) => {
    const editPath = pkg.type === 'Activity' 
      ? `/operator/packages/create/activity?id=${pkg.id}`
      : pkg.type === 'Transfer'
      ? `/operator/packages/create/transfer?id=${pkg.id}`
      : pkg.type === 'Multi-City'
      ? `/operator/packages/create/multi-city?id=${pkg.id}`
      : `/operator/packages/create?id=${pkg.id}`;
    router.push(editPath);
  };
  ```

### 3. **Duplicate Button** ✅
- **Before**: Only showed a toast message, didn't duplicate anything
- **After**: Fully functional duplication that:
  - Fetches the original package from the database
  - Creates a copy with "(Copy)" appended to the title
  - Sets status to "draft"
  - Duplicates all associated images
  - Refreshes the packages list to show the new package
  - Supports all package types: Activity, Transfer, and Multi-City
- **Features**:
  - User authentication check
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Automatic package list refresh after duplication
  - Statistics update

### 4. **Delete Button** ✅
- **Before**: Only showed a toast message, didn't delete anything
- **After**: Fully functional deletion that:
  - Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Deletes the package from the database
  - Ensures user owns the package (security check)
  - Updates local state immediately
  - Updates statistics (total count, active count)
  - Shows success/error messages
- **Features**:
  - Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
  - User authentication check
  - Ownership verification
  - Error handling
  - Immediate UI update

## Technical Improvements

1. **Added Next.js Router**: Imported and used `useRouter` from `next/navigation` for proper client-side navigation
2. **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript error with status field by using `'draft' as const`
3. **Error Handling**: All operations include proper error handling with user-friendly toast messages
4. **Security**: Delete and duplicate operations verify user ownership
5. **UI Feedback**: Loading states and success/error messages for all operations
6. **Database Support**: Works with all three package types (Activity, Transfer, Multi-City)
7. **Image Handling**: Duplicate operation properly copies all associated images

## Supported Package Types

All operations work with:
- ✅ Activity Packages (`activity_packages` table)
- ✅ Transfer Packages (`transfer_packages` table)
- ✅ Multi-City Packages (`multi_city_packages` table)

## User Experience Improvements

1. **View**: Quick navigation to view package details
2. **Edit**: Seamless editing experience with proper routing
3. **Duplicate**: Easy package duplication to create similar packages quickly
4. **Delete**: Safe deletion with confirmation to prevent accidents

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test View button with all package types
2. Test Edit button navigation and data loading
3. Test Duplicate button:
   - Verify new package appears in the list
   - Check that images are duplicated
   - Verify status is set to "draft"
   - Confirm title has "(Copy)" appended
4. Test Delete button:
   - Verify confirmation dialog appears
   - Ensure package is removed from database
   - Check that UI updates immediately
   - Verify only the package owner can delete

## Files Modified

- `src/app/operator/packages/page.tsx` - Main packages page with all dropdown menu functionality

## Build Status

✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
✅ All linter checks passed
