# ‚úÖ Transfer Form Fixes - Applied

## üêõ Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Base Pricing Duplication** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Base pricing showed in both Vehicle Options AND Pricing & Policies tabs

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `PricingPoliciesTab.tsx` to read vehicles from `vehicleOptions.vehicles` instead of separate `basePricing` array
- Now shows vehicle name, type, and price correctly
- Single source of truth for base prices

**File Changed:** `src/components/packages/forms/tabs/PricingPoliciesTab.tsx`

---

### 2. **Base Price Display in Pricing Tab** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Pricing tab was looking for `watchedData.basePricing` which didn't exist

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `watch('vehicleOptions')` to get vehicle data
- Changed display logic to use `vehicleOptions.vehicles` with proper null checks
- Shows "No vehicles configured yet" message when empty

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before:
const watchedData = watch('pricingPolicies');
{watchedData.basePricing.map(...)} // ‚ùå Wrong path

// After:
const watchedData = watch('pricingPolicies');
const vehicleOptions = watch('vehicleOptions');
{vehicleOptions?.vehicles.map(...)} // ‚úÖ Correct path
```
