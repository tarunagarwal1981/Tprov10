## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- No errors in browser console about cache/storage
- Login works after logout
- No infinite loading states
- Proper redirection after login
- Clean console logs showing successful auth flow

### ‚ùå Warning Signs (Should NOT Happen):
- Errors about "session expired" on fresh login
- Login button stays disabled after entering credentials
- Infinite "Signing in..." loading state
- Console errors about localStorage/cookies
- "Failed to initialize authentication" errors

## üêõ If Issues Occur

### Check Browser Console:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any red errors
4. Share the errors if any appear

### Check Application Storage:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Check Local Storage
4. Look for keys starting with `sb-` or `supabase`
5. These should be automatically managed - don't manually clear

### Clear Browser Cache (Last Resort):
If you still have issues from old cached code:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "All time"
3. Check: "Cached images and files" and "Cookies and site data"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Close browser completely
6. Reopen and try again

## üìù Changes Made

1. ‚úÖ Removed automatic cache clearing from login page
2. ‚úÖ Improved logout function to properly clear session
3. ‚úÖ Enhanced Supabase client with proper persistence settings
4. ‚úÖ Fixed auth initialization to be less aggressive

## üéØ Expected Behavior

**Before Fix**:
- ‚ùå Login in incognito: Works
- ‚ùå Logout + Login again in incognito: Fails
- ‚ùå Logout + Login in normal mode: Fails

**After Fix**:
- ‚úÖ Login in incognito: Works
- ‚úÖ Logout + Login again in incognito: Works
- ‚úÖ Logout + Login in normal mode: Works
- ‚úÖ Multiple logout/login cycles: Work

## üí° Technical Notes

The issue was caused by aggressive automatic cache clearing that was interfering with Supabase's session management. The fix trusts Supabase's built-in session handling instead of manually clearing cache.

**No database changes were made** - this was purely a client-side session management fix.
