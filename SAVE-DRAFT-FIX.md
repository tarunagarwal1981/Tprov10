# ✅ Save Draft Fix - Activity Package Form

## 🐛 Issue Identified

When clicking "Save Draft" in the Activity Package form, users were redirected to a "Page Not Found" error.

**Screenshot Analysis:**
- Page showed: "Page Not Found - Sorry, we couldn't find the page you're looking for"
- Console showed successful authentication and session management
- The issue was NOT authentication-related

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**File**: `src/hooks/useActivityPackage.ts` (Line 126)

```typescript
if (newPackage) {
  setActivityPackage(newPackage);
  router.push(`/operator/packages/${newPackage.id}`); // ❌ This page doesn't exist!
  return true;
}
```

**Problem**: After saving a draft, the hook automatically redirected to `/operator/packages/{packageId}`, but this route was never created, causing the "Page Not Found" error.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File**: `src/hooks/useActivityPackage.ts`

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed automatic redirect on save** (Line 126-128)
```typescript
if (newPackage) {
  setActivityPackage(newPackage);
  // Don't redirect on save - stay on form to continue editing
  // router.push(`/operator/packages/${newPackage.id}`);
  toast.success('Activity package saved successfully!'); // Added toast
  return true;
}
```

2. **Added toast notifications**
   - Import added: `import { toast } from 'sonner';`
   - Create: Shows "Activity package saved successfully!"
   - Update: Shows "Activity package updated successfully!"

   - Users can save drafts without errors

2. **Better User Experience** ✅
   - Users stay on the form to continue editing
   - Clear feedback with success toasts

3. **Consistent Behavior** ✅
   - Save Draft = Stay and edit

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Optional: Create Package Detail Page
If you want users to view saved packages:

1. Create `/operator/packages/[id]/page.tsx`
2. Display package details
3. Add "Edit" button to go back to form
4. Then the redirect would work

### Optional: Add "Save and View" Button
```typescript
<Button onClick={handleSaveAndView}>
  Save and View Package
</Button>
```

This would save AND redirect to the packages list.
