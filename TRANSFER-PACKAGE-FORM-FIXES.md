### 5. **Type System Updates** ✅

Updated TypeScript types in `transfer-package.ts`:

```typescript
export interface VehicleDetail {
  id: string;
  vehicleName: string;
  vehicleType?: VehicleType;
  maxCapacity: number;
  vehicleImage?: ImageInfo | null;
  order: number;
}

export interface TransferDetails {
  // ... existing fields
  vehicles: VehicleDetail[];
}
```

### 6. **Database Integration** ✅

Updated `transfer-packages.ts` service:

- **Vehicle Data Mapping**: Properly maps from new `transferDetails.vehicles` structure
- **Image Handling**: Vehicle images are uploaded and stored with proper references
- **Storage**: Each vehicle image is associated with the package and tagged with vehicle name in alt_text
- **Display Order**: Vehicle images use order 1000+ to keep them separate from package images

### 7. **UI/UX Consistency** ✅

All components follow the existing theme:
- Uses `package-text-fix`, `package-button-fix`, `package-animation-fix` classes
- Consistent card styling with `package-selector-glass` and `package-shadow-fix`
- Dark mode support throughout
- Proper hover states and transitions
- Accessible color contrasts
- Responsive layout (2-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile)

- Real-time form updates without page reload
- Smooth animations for add/remove actions
- Proper form state management using React hooks
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

```tsx
<VehicleDetailRow
  vehicle={vehicle}
  index={index}
  onUpdate={(updatedVehicle) => { /* update logic */ }}
  onRemove={(id) => { /* delete logic */ }}
  control={control}
/>
```

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Form loads with 1 empty vehicle row
- ✅ Add vehicle button creates new rows
- ✅ Delete button removes vehicle rows
- ✅ Vehicle name validation (required)
- ✅ Vehicle type dropdown works with proper styling
- ✅ Max capacity increment/decrement buttons work
- ✅ Vehicle image upload functions correctly
- ✅ Description field is optional (no validation error)
- ✅ Title field remains mandatory
- ✅ Dark mode styling works properly
- ✅ Responsive layout on mobile devices
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## Database Schema

The vehicle data is stored in the `transfer_package_vehicles` table with the following mapping:

| Form Field | Database Column | Type | Required |
|------------|----------------|------|----------|
| vehicleName | name | string | Yes |
| vehicleType | vehicle_type | enum | No |
| maxCapacity | passenger_capacity | number | Yes |
| vehicleImage | (via images table) | image | No |
| order | display_order | number | Yes |

Vehicle images are stored in `transfer_package_images` table with:
- `alt_text`: "Vehicle: {vehicleName}"
- `display_order`: 1000 + vehicle index
- Standard image metadata (file_name, file_size, mime_type, etc.)

## Notes

1. **Vehicle Images**: Each vehicle can have its own image, stored separately from package images
2. **Type Safety**: All components are fully typed with TypeScript
3. **Form State**: Uses React Hook Form for efficient state management
4. **Validation**: Integrated with form validation system
5. **Accessibility**: All form fields are properly labeled and accessible
6. **Theme Consistency**: Follows existing color scheme and styling patterns

## Next Steps

The transfer package form is now ready for:
- User testing
- Integration with backend API
- Additional vehicle features if needed
- Enhanced validation rules
- Multi-language support
